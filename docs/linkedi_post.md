🚀 **Submitted: Google + Kaggle AI Agents Intensive Capstone**

I just submitted my project:  
**➡️ LexFabric Agents — Deterministic Timeline Reconstruction**

This system tackles a real problem in law, compliance, and investigations:  
**LLMs hallucinate timelines when evidence is scattered across documents.**

To address this, I built a **hybrid multi-agent architecture** where:

- **Gemini handles text extraction**
- **Deterministic Python code orders all timestamps (ISO 8601)**
- **Each event is bound to a SHA-256 document hash**
- **Q&A answers only when grounded in verified evidence**

The result: a **zero-hallucination timeline**, reproducible end-to-end — even across fragmented PDFs, emails, and logs.

🧪 Includes a synthetic evidence server for deterministic evaluation.

Excited to continue expanding this toward causality graphs and full multi-docket analysis.
