What is the primary function of the LexFabric Agents project?,"It is a multi-agent evidence and timeline reasoning system that ingests synthetic evidence, constructs a timeline, and answers questions."
"The LexFabric Agents project is built with a deterministic, evidence-_____ pipeline.",bound
What is the nature of all evidence used by the LexFabric Agents system for the Capstone demo?,All evidence is fully synthetic.
Which component in the architecture is responsible for exposing synthetic cases and evidence files via simple tools?,The Synthetic Evidence Server.
What is the specific role of the Evidence Agent in the pipeline?,It loads evidence metadata and raw text from the synthetic evidence server.
"Which agent is responsible for extracting dates and events to build a structured, ordered narrative?",The Timeline Agent.
"Where does the system store normalized fragments like entities, dates, summaries, and events for retrieval?",In the Memory Bank.
How does the Q&A Agent answer user questions to ensure its responses are grounded?,By searching the memory bank and walking the ordered timeline for sequence-sensitive queries.
What is the function of the lightweight Router in the LexFabric system?,"It coordinates which agent runs when, based on the CLI mode (e.g., list-evidence, ask)."
"What core challenge, common in legal and investigative workflows, does the LexFabric system address?","Reconstructing coherent, chronological timelines from dozens or hundreds of fragmented artifacts that arrive out of order."
What specific hashing algorithm is used throughout the pipeline to ensure reproducibility and integrity?,SHA-256.
Name one key benefit of using a SHA-256 hash manifest for all ingested files.,"It ensures chain-of-custody fidelity, version reproducibility, deduplication, or test-stable evaluation."
What is the term for the design principle that ensures all reasoning is grounded purely in the ingested files?,Evidence-bound reasoning.
"As a safety feature, the system is designed for offline execution. Why is this important?","It prevents external data leakage and ensures a controlled, reproducible environment."
What does the `list_cases()` tool on the Synthetic Evidence Server do?,"It lists all available synthetic cases, such as CC02 and RH10."
Which tool is used to retrieve the raw content of a specific evidence file from the server?,The `get_evidence_text()` tool.
What information does the `get_evidence_hashes()` tool provide?,It produces a SHA-256 manifest for the evidence files in a case.
For what event was the LexFabric Agents Capstone Demo created?,The Google AI Agents Intensive (2025).
"The private, professional system that will extend the capstone project's foundation is named the LexFabric _____.",MDLS (Multi-Docket Litigation System)
Identifying the earliest event in a case and its source file is an example of what reasoning pattern?,Timeline Reconstruction.
What is the goal of the 'Cross-Document Contradiction Detection' reasoning pattern?,To find conflicting information between different pieces of evidence.
"An 'Actor-Centric Narrative' query, such as asking what a claimant did in a date range, performs what kind of search across the timeline?",An interval search.
The 'Causal/Procedural Reasoning' pattern aims to identify chains of events without doing what?,Inventing facts or hallucinating information.
The 'Hash-Provenance Display' test shows each timeline entry along with what piece of associated data?,Its originating SHA-256 file hash.
"The system's design with specialized agents, each having clear and non-overlapping responsibilities, is described as a strong _____-agent design.",multi
How does the combination of synthetic evidence and a hash manifest contribute to the project's evaluation?,It allows for deterministic and perfectly reproducible evaluation.
How is the Q&A Agent specifically designed to prevent hallucination?,It is a rule-based system that explicitly refuses to invent information and states when data is missing.
The Router coordinates agents based on the CLI mode. Name the three modes mentioned.,"The modes are list-evidence, list-timeline, and ask."
"The repository contains multiple synthetic cases, such as CC02 and _____, to ensure the system generalizes.",RH10
Name two types of synthetic evidence files included in the cases to demonstrate the system's versatility.,"Emails, notes, filings, incident reports, or timeline fragments."
"In the Kaggle writeup's detailed breakdown, which agent extracts actor names, pulls date fragments, and derives event summaries?",The Analysis Agent.
"Beyond sorting events, what does the Timeline Agent mark on entries to reflect ambiguity?",It marks uncertainty.
"The 'Kaggle Writeup' claims the project has clear _____-world value, a key strength in the competition.",real
"The system's core function is to transform raw, fragmented files into a _____ narrative.",chronological
For what type of queries does the Q&A agent need to 'walk the ordered timeline'?,Sequence-sensitive queries.
"The Kaggle writeup states that while LLMs excel at summarizing single documents, they struggle with _____ events across multiple files.",ordering
Term: Provenance,"The ability to trace facts, events, or information back to their original source document."
"The Kaggle writeup describes the Q&A agent as a grounded, rule-based system with what constraint on its operations?",It makes no external API calls.
What is an example of an insight the 'Gap Detection' reasoning pattern might produce?,"It can identify missing timestamps, insufficient emails, or absent follow-up logs."
What is the first future work item listed for the production-level deployment of LexFabric Agents?,Semantic embedding indexing.
"The project's architecture parallels features used in what private, professional evidence automation environment?",The LexFabric MDLS (Multi-Docket Litigation System).
"To validate the system, a test harness runs how many distinct, real-world reasoning patterns?",10 reasoning patterns.
The 'Evidence-Grounded 4-Sentence Summary' must contain zero _____ and reference only loaded files.,hallucinations
What does the 'Entity Cross-Section' reasoning pattern find?,"It finds all events involving a target role or entity, such as 'operations manager'."
